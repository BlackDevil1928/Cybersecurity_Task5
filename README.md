# 🛡️ Cyber Security Internship - Task 5

## 📌 Task Title:
**Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark**

## 🧠 Objective:
Capture live network packets using Wireshark and identify basic protocols and traffic types.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used:
- **Wireshark** – for packet capture and protocol analysis
- **Browser / Terminal** – to generate network traffic
- **GitHub** – for task submission

---

## 🗂️ Files Included:
- `capture/yourname_task5.pcap` – Network packet capture file
- `README.md` – Task report and findings
- *(Optional)* `screenshots/` – Screenshots of filters used or interesting packets

---

## 🔍 Protocols Identified:
1. **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**
   - Used in reliable connections such as HTTP
2. **DNS (Domain Name System)**
   - Used to resolve domain names like `google.com` to IP addresses
3. **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**
   - Used to transfer web content

---

## 📝 Packet Details (Examples):
- **TCP Packet**
  - Source: `192.168.0.105`
  - Destination: `142.250.190.46`
  - Info: `TCP handshake SYN, ACK`
- **DNS Packet**
  - Query: `www.example.com`
  - Response IP: `93.184.216.34`
- **HTTP Packet**
  - GET request to `http://example.com/index.html`

---

## 🤖 Why Is This Useful in Cybersecurity?
Packet capture and analysis helps:
- Detect suspicious activity
- Troubleshoot network problems
- Understand application behavior
- Spot unauthorized data transmission
